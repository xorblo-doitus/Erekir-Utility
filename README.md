A Java Mindustry mod made from [Anuke's template](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryJavaModTemplate).

## What does it add ?

Currently, not that much :
- **Stingy Duct** : Stops moving items when core is full of the currently moved item. (Unnecessary on serpulo because it's doable with processors)
